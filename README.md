# MTA-Project
This is a subway clock that displays the arrival times of the nearest 2, 3, 4 and 5 trains to the Borough Hall / Court Street subway station in downtown Brooklyn. 
It's powered by a 32x64 Adafruit DGB LED Matrix and a Raspberry Pi. We used BeautifulSoup to parse the data from a website which displays the arrival times. The case was built using Legos. We placed it in the main area of our school, where it still exists and functions to this day.
