# MTA-Project
This is a subway clock that displays the arrival times of the nearest 2, 3, 4 and 5 trains to the Borough Hall / Court Street subway station in downtown Brooklyn. 
It's powered by a 32x764 Adafruit DGB LED Matrix and a Raspberry Pi. The case was built using Legos. We placed it in the main area of our school, where it still exists and functions to this day.
